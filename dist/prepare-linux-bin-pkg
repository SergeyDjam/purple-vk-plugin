#!/bin/bash

# This trivial script prepares binary package (two plugin versions and a simple installer),
# which is suitable for older systems (e.g. RHEL 6.5).
#
# The binaries must be already built (I use CentOS 6.5 with devtoolset 1.1) and be located
# in bin/i386 and bin/x86_64.
#
# The output is a purple-vk-plugin-VERSION-bin.tar.gz file, which contains both binaries,
# data file and install.sh script.
