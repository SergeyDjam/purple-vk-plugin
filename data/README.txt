The files in this directory should go into:
 * Linux: /usr/share/pixmaps/pidgin
 * Windows: TODO

RANT: It is really unfortunate that unlike plugins (which can be stored in ~/.purple)
protocol icons on Linux must be located only in /usr/share and require root for installation.
We can only hope that relocatable apps will finally become popular and all these fixed DATADIRs
will finally disappear.
