 * Add support for creating/joining multi-user chats.
 * Add support for sending already stored files (compute md5sum).
 * Add support for receiving geo-information.
 * Add groups (PurpleBuddys will have duplicate names, is it ok?)
 * Update buddy info asynchronously on "Get Info".
 * Add fast setting of user presences via friends.getOnline and update all other user information later.
   Currently friends.get returns about 800 bytes per friend, which is a lot for mobile connections and modern
   Vk.com users with thousands of friends.
 * Split loading messages into "fast get unread" and "load chat history in background".
 * Check what's with Unicode on Windows (let's assume everyone runs UTF-8 on Linux). Check what's with
   building on windows.
 * Do HTTP retries on timeouts/50x errors?
