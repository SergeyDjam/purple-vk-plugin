 * Add support for sending IM.
 * Add support for loading big avatars in get_info.
 * Add support for creating/joining multi-user chats.
 * Support not overwriting client-side aliases and do something graceful with them.
 * Supply a mobile emblem.
 * Add groups (PurpleBuddys will have duplicate names, is it ok?)
 * Add once per-hour or per-half-hour updating of buddy list, so that we do not end up with stale
   avatars, status messages or buddy presences (the latter in case we somehow missed update from longpoll).
 * Update buddy info asynchronously on "Get Info".
 * Check what's with Unicode on Windows (let's assume everyone runs UTF-8 on Linux). Check what's with
   building on windows.
 * Support downloading message history (is log modification possible in libpurple?)
 * Do HTTP retries on timeouts/50x errors?
 * Investigate whether we can side-step captcha requests simply by waiting some timeout and repeating request.
   Looks like this is allowed.
