 * REDO contacts: store friends, store everyone who you communicated with (has
   history on server), store multichats.
   * Configure groups for friends, for everyone else, for multichats.
   * If adding, show some information on how to add friend.
   * If removing, show that we cannot remove.
   * If changing alias, store "locally_set" in buddy list and do not attempt
     to reset the alias.
 * Add buddies to blist right before receiving messages from them.
 * Do pings.

 * Add support for creating/joining multi-user chats.
 * Add support for loading big avatars in get_info.
 * Add support for sending already stored files (compute md5sum).
 * Add support for having non-friend contacts (get messages.getDialogs).
 * Add support for receiving geo-information.
 * Replace emoji unicode back with smiles?
 * Support not overwriting client-side aliases and do something graceful with them.
 * Supply a mobile emblem.
 * Add groups (PurpleBuddys will have duplicate names, is it ok?)
 * Update buddy info asynchronously on "Get Info".
 * Add fast setting of user presences via friends.getOnline and update all other user information later.
   Currently friends.get returns about 800 bytes per friend, which is a lot for mobile connections and modern
   Vk.com users with thousands of friends.
 * Split loading messages into "fast get unread" and "load chat history in background".
 * Check what's with Unicode on Windows (let's assume everyone runs UTF-8 on Linux). Check what's with
   building on windows.
 * Do HTTP retries on timeouts/50x errors?
 * Replace manual pointer lifetime management with shared_ptr everywhere.
