 * Add support for sending already stored files (compute md5sum).
 * Add support for having non-friend contacts (get messages.getDialogs).
 * Add support for receiving geo-information.
 * Add support for creating/joining multi-user chats.
 * Batch marking received messages as read.
 * Use exceptions in order to reduce error processing code? Use "get-with-default" wrappers?
 * Replace emoji unicode back with smiles?
 * Add support for loading big avatars in get_info.
 * Support not overwriting client-side aliases and do something graceful with them.
 * Supply a mobile emblem.
 * Add groups (PurpleBuddys will have duplicate names, is it ok?)
 * Update buddy info asynchronously on "Get Info".
 * Add fast setting of user presences via friends.getOnline and update all other user information later.
   Currently friends.get returns about 800 bytes per friend, which is a lot for mobile connections and modern
   Vk.com users with thousands of friends.
 * Check what's with Unicode on Windows (let's assume everyone runs UTF-8 on Linux). Check what's with
   building on windows.
 * Do HTTP retries on timeouts/50x errors?
 * Do something with constant copying of strings and std::functions on lambda capture. This is just ugly.
   Probably should use std::bind with std::move, but god, this will be ugly. At least, move from std::string
   to vstring on gcc, so that string copy would not induce malloc in most cases?
