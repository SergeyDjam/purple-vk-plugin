 * Add warning on uploading unsupported types? Automatically add to zip archive?
 * Add support for setting status according to the current music (does every player implement MPRIS now?)
 * Add (optional) pseudo-user for informing on replies/comments to photos/whatever.
 * Add support for receiving geo-information.
 * Add groups (PurpleBuddys will have duplicate names, is it ok?)
