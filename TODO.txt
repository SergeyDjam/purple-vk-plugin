 * Add support for creating/joining multi-user chats.
 * Add warning on uploading unsupported types? Automatically add to zip archive?
 * Add support for setting status according to the current music (does every player implement MPRIS now?)
 * Add (optional) pseudo-user for informing on replies/comments to photos/whatever.
 * Test bad connections with netem (emulate large packet loss, huge pings, random disconnects/timeouts)
 * Add support for receiving geo-information.
 * Add groups (PurpleBuddys will have duplicate names, is it ok?)
 * Add fast setting of user presences via friends.getOnline and update all other user information later.
   Currently friends.get returns about 800 bytes per friend, which is a lot for mobile connections and modern
   Vk.com users with thousands of friends.
